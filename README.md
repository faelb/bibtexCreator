# bibtexCreator
a small program where you can give your input for Internet articles to convert them into a Bibtex, which in term can be used for your BachelorThesis and the use of a Reference Atomation Software (f.e. Jabref)

it's very basic - don't expect something big

the problem with my first bac thesis was that everytime I had to add a reference to JabRef that was not a sweet Bibtex from ieee website or anywhere (mainly for website cites)
it was quite cumbersome to use the interface of JabRef to add such a new cite.
It's much more convenient to just copy a bibtex and let it add the metadata to jabref automatically.
So with this small programm you just copy paste the stuff from the internet article the program asks for, and at the end it will create you a bibtex string to just add to your
reference program.

This should help me with bac2 alot.

It could even be upgraded to use a webrawler and get all the data from the website itself (url, crawl for author -> if none is mentioned use unknown, set accessed to actual date,
read out the year of that website post, ....)  but I have no time right now to do that^^ maybe later.

Short note:    the refIndex which is the first one that the program asks for is the one that will be used in the Latex Textwriter implementation when citing the article.
